title: Progress Studies
---

For the past couple of years, I have been thinking deeply about the topic of progress. How do humans make frontier pushing progress? What can we do to enhance and optimize it?
 
In July 2019, Tyler Cowen and Patrick Collison wrote a piece for the Atlantic entitled: [We Need a New Science of Progress](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/), which galvanized a big discussion around the world. It inspired me to think more deeply about this fire that had been already burning inside of me.

We have started a progress studies group in San Francisco (virtually across the world), and if you are interested, please [let me know](mailto:abhisharma.b@gmail.com).
