title: Progress Studies

For the past couple of years, I have been thinking deeply about the topic of progress. How do humans make frontier pushing progress? What can we do to enhance and optimize it?
 
In July 2019, Tyler Cowen and Patrick Collison wrote a piece for the Atlantic entitled: We Need a New Science of Progress, which galvanized a big discussion in SF and around the world. It inspired me to think more deeply about the above fire that had been already burning inside of me.

More specifically, one thought that bothered me the most was that we are becoming an extremely hyper-specialized society, and what does it mean for us? Does hyper-specialization and thus fragmentation lead to a lack or slow-down of progress? I am continuing to research this subject, but so far, it seems the answer is an unequivocal - YES. 

We have started a progress studies group in San Francisco, and if you are interested, please [let me know](mailto:abhisharma.b@gmail.com).

Below is my collection of some resources around progress studies.
