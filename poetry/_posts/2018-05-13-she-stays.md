It is time to go; they all say 
A little while longer, she says:
Let me stay.

The warmth of the blanket,
The protection of her room.
Too hard to leave,
For the winterâ€™s gloom.
Just a little while longer, she says -
Let me stay.

It is important she needs to fly,
Wings tend to grow; when the leap is thrown.
They must be right, but the cliff is too high
A little while longer, she says - 
Let me say.

Soon enough the inevitable poaches.
There is no - "one last time...",
There is no delay.
A little while longer she cannot stay.

But the secret she should always remember,
For she was raised that way. 
She might go far; the wind beneath her wings and the ground beneath her feet will always stay.

With hazy eyes now, she peeps into her soul.
And it's all right there - just like home.
Fears goes away; she feels so strong.
Nothing's left behind, it was inside her all along.

She finds a way in like a magic trick.
Eyes closed, she can breathe back in.
This time with a wide smile and a glowing face, just a little while longer, she says - Let me stay.

But now she is grown and now she is found - a little while longer, she can always stay.
