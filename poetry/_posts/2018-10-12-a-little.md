Stop a while, a little,
Look around, a little,
Skip a beat, a little. 
Watch your heart play a fiddle.

The trees ask you the riddle,
While water tries to giggle,
The wind blows in your face;
Asking you to look inside a little.

Letâ€™s the pebbles dance around; walk a little,
And the sand whispers through the toes with that frittle,
Stop a while, just a little,
Look around, just a little,
Skip a beat, just a little,
You are alive; live a little.
