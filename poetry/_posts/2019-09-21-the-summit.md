It’s not the night that frightens but the darkness within I hold. So I look up to you; beaming white angel. But of-course I only look at a mirror; for with you there are no secrets yet to be told.

What I begin again, is my fight with myself. Moonlight skies you offer; so never again; I lose sight of my goal. You tingle my hands as I wiggle my toes. I now fear nothing; for I am back like a baby in my ‘mother’s hold.

A new me rises; blood orange breaking through clouds. My thoughts are still; my soul steady. Now, the dirt remains but only on my skin and my brow — my heart steers clear purified in your gold.
