abstract: Letter to my wife amidst Covid19
---

Sometimes those eyes, sometimes those words, sometimes that hug, Sometimes nothing but always everything, your presence.  

Funny, I want to be all in but also wish to be out. To observe the magic it spills, your presence.  

Starts somewhere in my heart, and spreads through my veins. As loud as the victory song; as tranquil as the deep sea; fire & ice, your presence.  

Wonder if I would know I am alive - if not, your presence.  

A frown turning to a smile, your presence.  
Stepping into a toasty room from a cold afternoon, your presence.  
Hope of the first light, morning dew, your presence.  
An incomplete "I" to a complete "We", your presence.  

Sometimes those eyes, sometimes those words, sometimes that hug, sometimes nothing but always everything, your presence.  

Love, 
Abhi
