Sometimes those eyes, sometimes those words, sometimes that hug, sometimes nothing but forever everything, your presence.  

At times enamored by it all, sometimes seeing from afar.  
The magic of it all, your presence.  

Starts somewhere in my heart, and spreads through my veins. As loud as the victory song; as tranquil as the deep sea; fire & ice, your presence.  

Wonder if I would know I am alive - if not, your presence.  

Stepping into a toasty room from a cold afternoon, your presence.  
Hope of the first light, morning dew. An incomplete "I" to a complete "We", your presence.  

Sometimes those eyes, sometimes those words, sometimes that hug, sometimes nothing but forever everything, your presence.  

Love,  
A
