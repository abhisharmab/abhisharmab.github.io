abstract: How to systematically think about your career
---

Possibly with the New Year, a lot of you are strategically thinking about your career. I always reflect on mine at this time. I happened to chat with a friend today who was in the same mindset. It occurred to me, that some of the reading & advise I was soaking in myself (scroll down to the bottom for the consolidated list) might be useful to other people. At-least some of you might resonate with these ideas. So I decided to write it down.

I have concluded, the only thing that matters when you are figuring out what to do with your career is figuring out -- WHAT YOU REALLY LOVE? It is a tough one & you have to think very hard about what you really really want. It might take years to find out depending on layers of junk/rust you have on you. The junk/rust on you is basically all the things that are blocking you from understanding yourself clearly. This junk/rust is created based on community's impact on you, upbringing constraints, unconsiously gathered perceptions/bias, risk tolerability, & lack of deeper self-understanding. Having grown up in a lower-middle class family with a focus on survival, I had a bunch of this junk/rust on my own mental models. (Although on the positive side, with my background, you also tend to develop a lot of incredible potential to come through in tough situations that a comfortable life probably wouldn't imbibe in you.)

Doing what you love is the only way to have a meaningful, satisfying, and impactful career. To me, it seems a worthwhile pursuit; especially given work forms such a big part of your life. In the pursuit, you still have to deal with constraints of life like rent & food for which you need to learn to be smart & scrappy. This best thing to do in the interim ios figure out your general strengths & do high leverage activities in that area to get. Although, always be in a constant inward pursuit to figure out what you ultimately love to do. As a benchmark, you need to find something you can dedicate at least ten years of your life to. Sometimes just asking this question & then doing a systematic self-discovery phase itself can lead to the answer. The regular linear path to career growth, although safe, is both useless & not exciting.

I HIGHLY recommend the following material that will _not_ only guide your thinking but also give you a framework on figuring out what you want to do with your career. After reading each item you need to introspect, but be brutally honest to yourself, otherwise, it won't work. **Note:** Some readings below are certainly biased towards people working in tech.
