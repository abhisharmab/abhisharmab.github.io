abstract: Figuring out what you really love to do
---

Possibly with the New Year, 02020, a lot of you are strategically thinking about your career. I always reflect on mine a fair bit. I happened to chat with a friend today who was in the same mindset. It occurred to me that some of the thinking, reading, & advise I was soaking in myself might be useful to other people or at-least some might resonate with those ideas. So I decided to write it down.

I have firmly concluded, the only thing that matters when you are figuring out what to do with your career is figuring out -- WHAT YOU REALLY LOVE? It is a tough one & might even take years to find out depending on layers of junk/rust you have on yourself. The junk/rust on you is all the things that are blocking you from thinking or understanding yourself clearly. The rust is created based on your societal impact, upbringing constraints, default environmental perceptions, risk understanding, & lack of deeper self-understanding. Growing in a fairly poor-middle class family with a focus on survival, I had a bunch of this junk/rust on my mental models. Although on the positive side, you also tend to develop a lot of incredible potential to break through severe problems that a comfortable life probably wouldn't imbibe in you.

Figuring out & then doing what you love is the only way to have a meaningful, satisfying, and impactful career. To me, it seems the original worthwhile pursuit given work forms such a big part of your life. It doesn't mean you only have to do one thing in life. You can do several things, but you have got to find what you enjoy doing, otherwise, you are just floating by in life. The execution is easier said than done. You have to think very hard about what you really really want.

In the process, you still have to deal with life constraints like rent & food for which you need to be generally smart & scrappy. Figure out your general strengths & do high leverage activities in that area to get by but be in a constant inward pursuit to figure out what you  ultimately love to do. As a benchmark, something you can dedicate at least ten years of your life to. Sometimes just asking the question & then doing a systematic self-discovery phase itself can lead to this answer. Maybe the answer is staring you in the face, and you just aren't looking. IMO, the regular linear path to career growth trajectory although safe is both useless & not exciting

In my discovery journey, the following resources & thoughts were beneficial. I HIGHLY recommend the following reading material that will not only guide your thinking but give you a framework on figuring out what you want to do with your career. After reading each, you need to introspect yourself exceptionally honestly. Be brutally honest to yourself, otherwise, it won't work. **Note:** Some readings below are certainly biased towards people working in tech.
