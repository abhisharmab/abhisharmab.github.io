I am discovering the joy & value of reading via journaling. I started to journal [my learnings & insights here](https://abhisharmab.github.io/insights/), so I can study & re-visit them over time.

Out of all the beautiful things I learn - one prominent realization was - I had the least amount of interesting recordings/insights journaled in the weeks when I was not reading. Reason might be being lazy or extremely busy with other stuff. But when I was reading I had a lot of interesting thoughts & insights surface. In fact, sometimes, insights gathered had nothing to do with the reading material itself, but some associative connections were formed in my head. I wonder if the brain is in hyper-connection making mode while trying to read. Either way, the intellectual stimulation for me seems to be highly correlated to reading. Conclusion: find time to read daily. 

Do you observe the same? Are there any studies on this? Are some people innately wired to be thinkers, or is it a muscle you have to exercise; otherwise, it atrophies?
