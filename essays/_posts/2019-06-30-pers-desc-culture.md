abstract: What is the culture in your startup measured on this meta-dimension?
---

Culture is the most defining foundational aspect about your startup. It will drive the kind of company you will eventually become or not become. Given all the fire you have to fight as a founder especially in the struggle of the early stage, you will ignore this aspect. But remember, it is also the most un-fixable aspect of your company in retrospect (apart from small adjustments) unless you start fresh with brand new people (both employees and investors). Pretty hard to undo bad foundations. Thus, it is imperative, its done right from the get-go and you are explicit about it. Having bootstrapped 2 startups where the starting team size was 2-4 people, I can say it with much confidence that -- you can't quiet control all of culture's evolution either but the kind of foundations you lay down definitely seal it's fate. 

Numerous metrics and empirical evaluation frameworks of what culture is exist today. Popular principles and manifestos like the Day 1 from Jeff Bezos or Extreme Thoughful Dissent from Ray Dalio are available freely. It is obviously great to read, learn, and be inspired by them but at end of the day, culture is totally contextual to your startup and your particular situation. What worked for Jeff or Ray is certainly not going to work for you as-is and most certainly as a founder you are not Jeff or Ray. You are you, and the culture of your startup cannot be defined mimetically. You can read tons of books about this subject, carve out best learnings and try to apply them but it just doesn't quiet work like magic like you read about it in the book. Few things might stick but nothing radical or authentic will surface by just emulation. 

Note that measuring your cultural success against some well-sanitized metrics is not necessarily bad. So I am not aruging against measurement but measuring a culture setup based on emulation is a waste of time. I made this mistake of trying to emulate good ideas, practices, and guidelines from the greatest of the great. Obviously, the media is excellent at highlightning the success stories and somehow, before you know it, it starts to feel like a receipe. You start to follow things blindly without questioning if it's the right thing for you, right timing for you, are you in the same kind of market dynamics, does it fit for your people, does it fit with who you are, and especially why you are doing this. Truth is, there isn't a singular answer apart from general ethical guidlines. The radical ideas that worked somewhere can't just be adopted blindly in your context. 

So what works? How should one go about thinking about this stuff? I thought about this for a long time and actually found my answer rooted in eastern philosophy. So instead of making this a empricial subject full of anecdotes and data, what worked for me is, rather thinking about this in a meta-thematic structure. I think it covers a core principle that according to me is context-agnostic and actually holds true for every startup. Therefore, I think, a much better guiding principle than recipes or examples or prescriptions.

If you don't agree that a strong culture is casually related to building a strong company then read no further. Do what you think is best; but if you agree - here it goes.

First, let's look at the abstract idea of culture from a more concrete dimension. The dimension being: how does culture manifest itself. How do we observe (subjectively or objectively) what is the culture at a particular startup? I think it is governed by two themes: 
1. *behavioral dynamics* - how people feel, behave, interact, disagree, and conclude
2. *style of working* - how people analyze, plan and execute

These two themes systematically cut across all of your organization and when you think about good culture in action, it's basically optimal instantiation of these themes in your startup. You want to optimize for a very stable, meaningful, intellectually stimulating *behavioral dynamics* and resilient, high-quality, and efficient *style of working*.

To explain with an example: at FogHorn (my startup) we build a real-time analytics & machine learning platform used in oil & gas, manufacturing, mining, and health-care industry for predictive maintainence, operational safety, and efficiency. Now, this is not a vertical SaaS, cool productivity tool type of company. Our customers take a solution and expect it to run with almost no maintainence and run forever without a hiccup. Sometimes real lives are dependant on it. Using a "fail fast and break things" cultural mind-set is not going to be a good foundation for building this type of company. It will setup behavioral dynamics that are completely different to what you really need. You also risk hiring a completely wrong set of people. Although, this is a simplistic example, hopefully it explains what I mean by your startup's context. 

To figure out what your culture and it's foundation principles should be you have to actually digger deeper within. It is orthogonal to the cliched questions investors will generally ask you and media will highlight. It's truly the heart of your company that no-one sees like you do. 

To summarize this point -- what you are trying to do when you define culture is optimize for behavioral dynamics and style of working. You do that based on the vision and the context of your startup. Some good questions to ask are: 
1. Why did I start this in the first place? What was the main inspiration?
2. What market are we playing in and what is the mind-set of this market? 
3. What story do you want the customer to hear about you? 
4. If you took each employee into a different room, interviewd them separately about what your culture is - what is the one common answer you would like everyone to have?
5. What is your own internal ambition of where you want to take this? Be 100% honest about this to yourself.

Ask the questions enough times to yourself and answers will certainly come. You wouldn't have embark on the completely illogical path of being an enterprenuer otherwise. 

To explain with another example: let's say crank-test like for style of working... (to be filled)

Let's assume above makes sense, and you have some principles figured out that will defined your cultural foundation. It's always good idea to actually write them down, continously refine the wording, and repeat it over and over and over again. Just over-communicate it. 

Another major pitfall you could make is being prescriptive about culture rather than descriptive about it in your messaging. It is a nuance but very important, IMO. Descriptive approach you describe a end-state, a goal you want to achieve and leave room for people to collaborate and figure out a structure to get to that state. You don't say you MUST do this and this and this.
