abstract: Thoughts on culture

Culture is the most foundational aspect of your startup. It ultimately drives the kind of company you will eventually become. It is also one of the most unfixable elements of your company in retrospect; apart from small adjustments maybe. So make sure you are explicit and thoughtful about it from the get-go. Having bootstrapped a startup, where we went from 4 to 100 people in 4 years, I can say it with confidence that -- you can't entirely control all of your culture's evolution either, but the kind of foundations you lay down seals its fate. 

Numerous metrics, empirical frameworks, and examples of what defines thriving culture exist today. Popular principles and manifestos like the Day 1 from Jeff Bezos or Extreme Thoughtful Dissent from Ray Dalio are available freely. It is excellent to read, learn, and be inspired by them, but at the end of the day, culture is very contextual to your startup. What worked for Jeff or Ray is certainly not going to work for you as-is. Most certainly as a founder, you are not Jeff or Ray. You are you, and the culture of your startup cannot be defined mimetically by just emulating good ideas, practices, and guidelines from the greatest of the great. The media is excellent at highlighting the success stories, and somehow, before you know it, it starts to feel like a recipe. You begin to follow things blindly without questioning if it's the right thing for you, the right timing for you, does it meet your market dynamics, does it fit for your people, does it agree with who you are, and especially why you are doing this. The truth is, there isn't a magical answer apart from general guidelines. The radical ideas that worked somewhere can't be adopted blindly in your context. 

So what works? How should one go about thinking about this stuff? What worked for me is - thinking about this as a meta-thematic structure. Not just looking at empirical data-driven approach but thinking about it as a holistic theory. I think it covers a core principle that is context-agnostic and holds for every startup. Therefore, I believe, a much better guiding principle than recipes or examples or prescriptions.

Let's look at the abstract idea of culture from a more concrete dimension. The dimension being: how does culture manifest itself. How do we observe (subjectively or objectively) what is the culture at a particular startup? I think it is governed by two themes: 
1. *behavioral dynamics* - how people feel, behave, interact, disagree, and conclude
2. *style of working* - how people analyze, plan and execute

These two themes systematically cut across all of your organization and when you think about good culture in action, it's basically optimal instantiation of these themes in your startup. You want to optimize for a very stable, meaningful, intellectually stimulating *behavioral dynamics* and resilient, high-quality, and efficient *style of working*.

To explain with an example: at FogHorn (my startup) we build a real-time analytics & machine learning platform used in oil & gas, manufacturing, mining, and health-care industry for predictive maintainence, operational safety, and efficiency. Now, this is not a vertical SaaS, cool productivity tool type of company. Our customers take a solution and expect it to run with almost no maintainence and run forever without a hiccup. Sometimes real lives are dependant on it. Using a "fail fast and break things" cultural mind-set is not going to be a good foundation for building this type of company. It will setup behavioral dynamics that are completely different to what you really need. You also risk hiring a completely wrong set of people. Although, this is a simplistic example, hopefully it explains what I mean by your startup's context. 

To figure out what your culture and it's foundation principles should be you have to actually digger deeper within. It is orthogonal to the cliched questions investors will generally ask you and media will highlight. It's truly the heart of your company that no-one sees like you do. 

To summarize this point -- what you are trying to do when you define culture is optimize for behavioral dynamics and style of working. You do that based on the vision and the context of your startup. Some good questions to ask are: 
1. Why did I start this in the first place? What was the main inspiration?
2. What market are we playing in and what is the mind-set of this market? 
3. What story do you want the customer to hear about you? 
4. If you took each employee into a different room, interviewd them separately about what your culture is - what is the one common answer you would like everyone to have?
5. What is your own internal ambition of where you want to take this? Be 100% honest about this to yourself.

Ask the questions enough times to yourself and answers will certainly come. You wouldn't have embark on the completely illogical path of being an enterprenuer otherwise. 

To explain with another example: let's say crank-test like for style of working... (to be filled)

Let's assume above makes sense, and you have some principles figured out that will defined your cultural foundation. It's always good idea to actually write them down, continously refine the wording, and repeat it over and over and over again. Just over-communicate it. 

Another major pitfall you could make is being prescriptive about culture rather than descriptive about it in your messaging. It is a nuance but very important, IMO. Descriptive approach you describe a end-state, a goal you want to achieve and leave room for people to collaborate and figure out a structure to get to that state. You don't say you MUST do this and this and this.
