Even though I was away from home for ~3 weeks when my flight touched down at SFO airport on a pleasant 73-degree sunny afternoon, I felt like a part of me was missing. It's like something was left behind in Africa. At first, I thought, it was just the lack of sleep, but as time passed by and I was all settled in the comfort of my home the feeling of something missing lingered. Having spent 8 days on the tallest mountain in Africa (Kilimanjaro) with no connection to my routine life in the Bay Area I had felt a deep sense of focus and stillness. Turns out, I had been missing that continued sense of focus and stillness. I have always been attracted to hiking and free-standing mountains but the top of Kili was something else entirely. Felt like I had been removed from my usual life and transplanted onto a brand new planet all together. It was completely captivating. 

**Singular Focus and Calm**:  
My most vivid memory is this *deep sense of singular focus* that I felt while hiking, especially the summit night. When you are climbing a steep uphill in -10 degree (celsius) weather trying not to slip from one edge of the mountain, the exclusive focus you have is on your breathe and your next step. Not another single thought for a long time, like an intense meditative state. It was highly refreshing. A deeply satisfying feeling and offering a very calming effect for the mind. I was no longer in rush, or a continous context switch or some thought process. I was exclusively experiencing an elevated sense of patience and focus. No distribuance, no worries. 

**Team Effort**:  
A hard to forget part of the Kili climb is that it is such a huge team-effort. This makes climbing Kili even more special. Not only do you develop a bond with the mountain but also the your team. Unless you are some top-notch climber it's almost impossible to do Kili without a fablous team of guides and porters, who actually do most of the heavy lifting (both literally and figuratively). After 8 days, you actually feel closer to them than some of your friends that you might not have met in a long time. A bond created in some sense of adversity is one of the strongest bonds. Most of your team can barely speak a work of english but they communicate with gestures and their eyes. I could tell for most of them it was more than a means of liveihood. Most of them were just in love with the mountain. The mountain as adopted them and they have adopted the mountain. I learnt three great lessons about a successfully team here: 1. Unwavering trust, 2. Clearly defined goal, and 3. Not thinking about that goal at all but rather optimizing the inputs parameters towards the goal. Apart from literally carrying you the team did everything in the power to facilitate the summit. It re-enforced a sense of vision and importance of the goal in me. The goal can be extremely tough, but it has to be clearly defined. And then the better the alignment of incentives towards the goals; the better the chances for success. It's equally important to not fret about the end result all the time or keep looking at the summit. Rather you optimize things you can control: proper rest, positive mental state, high water intake, good diet, stretching and training, climbing slow (pole-pole), accimalization hikes etc. that eventually guarantee a successful climb.
