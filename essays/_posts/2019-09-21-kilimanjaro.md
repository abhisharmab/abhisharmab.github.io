Even though I was away from home for ~3 weeks when my flight touched down at SFO airport on a pleasant 73-degree sunny afternoon, I felt like a part of me was missing. It's like something was left behind in Africa. At first, I thought, it was just the lack of sleep, but as time passed by and I was all settled in the comfort of my home the feeling of something missing lingered. Having spent 8 days on the tallest mountain in Africa (Kilimanjaro) with no connection to my routine life in the Bay Area I had felt a deep sense of focus and stillness. _Turns out, I had been missing that continued sense of focus and stillness_. I have always been attracted to hiking and free-standing mountains but the top of Kili was something else entirely. Felt like I had been removed from my usual life and transplanted onto a brand new planet all together. It was completely captivating. 

**Singular Focus and Calm**:
My most vivid memory is this *deep sense of singular focus* that I felt while hiking, especially the summit night. When you are climbing a steep uphill in -10 degree (celsius) weather trying not to slip from one edge of the mountain, the exclusive focus you have is on your breathe and your next step. Not another single thought for a long time, like an intense meditative state. It was highly refreshing. A deeply satisfying feeling and offering a very calming effect for the mind. I was no longer in rush, or a continous context switch or some thought process. I was exclusively experiencing an elevated sense of patience and focus. No distribuance, no worries. 

**Team Effort**:

**Less is More**: 

**Victim to Observer**:

**Inspiration**: 

**Jambo, Jambo**: 

**Poetry**:
