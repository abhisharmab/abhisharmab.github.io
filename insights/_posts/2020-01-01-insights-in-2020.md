When travellng to a non-English speaking country make sure to spend enough time learning their language. It will make your experience 10x better. I made the mistake of going to Chile w/o putting any effort in learning Spanish, I totally regretted that decision. Obviously it isn't hard to get around using Google Translate but you don't get to make a real connection or conversation with the locals. In retrospect, it seems very abrasive & disrespectful to not make a genuine effort in trying to understand their language. Nonetheless, definitely download offline language models on your Google Translate app.
