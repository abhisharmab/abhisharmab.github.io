Product Market Fit Measurement via Andy Rachleff:  
**Enterprise:**  
1.Sales Yield > 1 [HBR Article](https://hbr.org/2006/07/the-sales-learning-curve)  
2.Pull the product after 30 days of trial or PoC. Customer needs to yell that they need it.  

**Consumer:**  
1.Organic word of mouth (WoM) growth (not purchased or gamed growth but exponential organic growth)  
2.NPS (Net Promoter Score) - A Decent (not the best) Proxy for WoM  


When travellng to a non-English speaking country make sure to spend enough time learning their language. It will make your experience 10x better. I made the mistake of going to Chile w/o putting any effort in learning Spanish, I totally regretted that decision. Obviously it isn't hard to get around using Google Translate but you don't get to make a real connection or conversation with the locals. In retrospect, it seems very abrasive & disrespectful to not make a genuine effort in trying to understand their language. Nonetheless, definitely download offline language models on your Google Translate app.
