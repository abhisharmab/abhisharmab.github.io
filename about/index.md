Current: I live in [Mountain View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California) and bootstrapped
[FogHorn](https://www.foghorn.io/). I also do unusual things at [Unusual Ventures](https://unusual.vc/). 

I was born in Northern India (close to the Himalayan range). Previously studied Computer Science and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh (CMU). Obessed with figuring out how the brain and the world works.

If you are a first time tech founder feeling ready to bootstrap, or looking to raise a seed round, or seek advice about venture capital, or just bounce off ideas feel free to reach out to me at [abhi@unusual.vc](mailto:abhi@unusual.vc).
