I live in Silicon Valley and bootstrapped
[FogHorn](https://www.foghorn.io/). I often do unusual things at [Unusual Ventures](https://unusual.vc/) and tweet as [abhisharma_b](https://twitter.com/abhisharma_b).

I was born in Northern India (close to the Himalayan range). Previously studied Computer Science and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh. Obessed with the workings of wine, human intelligence and the world.
