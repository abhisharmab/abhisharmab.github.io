Consolidated list of meaningful donation choices, based on my research.

### Donation Choices:  

* [Support for Mt. Kilimanjaro Porters](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-mt-kili-porters?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet)

* [MRelief](https://www.mrelief.com/coronavirus)    
Helping people get government benefits; given massive unemployment situation.  

* [Flexport](https://flexport.org/donate/)  
Helping front-line health care workers get proper safety equipment.  
Shortage in safety equipment is mind boggling right now.  

* [OpenSourceVentilator](http://www.opensourceventilator.ie/)  
Group of Ireland designers, engineers, biotech experts, etc. collaborating to build cheap, open-source ventilators.  

* [HelpWithCovid](https://helpwithcovid.com/)  
Consolidated list for volunteering help rather than a donation

* [QBI_UCSF](https://twitter.com/QBI_UCSF)  
The team finished mapping the coronavirus genome and identified existing drugs that could potentially protect against COVID-19. They arenâ€™t officially open for donations yet, but I would bet my money here.  

* [Restaurant Worker's Relief Fund](https://www.restaurantworkerscf.org/news/2020/3/15/restaurant-workers-community-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-restaurant-workers-covid19-crisis-relief-fund)  
10% of the U.S workforce. Also one of the most vulnerable at this time. Most are likely to not have any health insurance.  

* [Marginal Revolution Prize Grant](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/1-million-plus-in-emergent-ventures-prizes-for-coronavirus-work.html)  
Just email Tyler Cowen directly.  

* [Tipping Point](https://tippingpoint.org/what-we-do/initiatives/emergency-response)  
Funding for low-income, most vulnerable group.

* [GiveDirectlyCovid](https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/)  
Very direct family help for people experiencing the Covid-19 in the most extreme ways.  

* [WHO Covid-19 Fund](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate)  
WHO solidarity response fund.
