As clickbait-y as the title of this book might seem, it is a must-read for anyone trying to bootstrap a startup. You will walk away with a deep understanding of VC and get actionable entrepreneurship advice. As a litmus test; I guarantee your pitch deck, how you approach VCs, which VCs you partner with, how you evaluate your startup and your termsheets - all of it will change slightly (for the better) after reading this book.

Having started a company before and then later bootstrapping [Foghorn](https://www.foghorn.io/) at an incubator, I was appalled at the information asymmetry that exists between LPs, VCs, and founders (especially technical founders). I learned it myself in hard ways. It made me feel furious, stupid, and even pity myself. But as with everything, you don't know what you don't know. In the long run, this disparity doesn't promote trust or incentive alignment. Possibly why I connected so strongly with Scott's book. The book is non-pretentious, from the heart, and is genuinely trying to eliminate the asymmetry mentioned above.

There are way too many useful nuggets to summarize but, personally, if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one meta takeaway - I would say the book helps you develop an appreciation and a working intuition for playing the **incentive alignment** game. 

Working intuition, once you have it, works like common sense. Kicks in when you need it. As you layout your startup one tile at a time (ideation, prototyping, fundraising, hiring, selling, marketing, partnering, scaling etc.) always ask yourself if the incentives are lining up and are you doing the right thing.

##### What is incentive alignment anyways?
I am sure you can Google some sort of formal definition. To me, it is the act of making sure all the people believe in, line up, and point in the same direction. Meaning people are actually correctly incentivized to head towards a singular common goal. It's okay for goals to change or evolve over time but people must align.

##### Why is it so important?
Because it helps:  
1.setup the right reward structures for everyone,  
2.inculcates a sense of urgency for progress and motivation,  
3.reduces tolerance towards complacency,   
4.establishes checks & balances in decision making,  
5.always helps the keep the long-term view in mind (very underrated).  

You can almost never build an outlier success single-handedly. No matter how smart you are. A lot of processes, people, market dynamics, and a good bit of luck have to come together for that to happen. One key dimension in all that (atleast as of today) is VC. So it's really important you embrace it, understand it, and truly make sure it lines up with your core intent. The guidance in the book helps you hash that out.

Concepts and ideas in the book are conveyed with an example or story first. For e.g. as common as it maybe; many people don’t understand what goto market (G2M) actually means. So the book doesn’t go - Goto Market: Definition but rather goes - here is a great story about Okta’s sales/marketing machinery, why it made sense, why it worked and by the way it’s called G2M. 

Chapters towards the end actually loose that example based style of writing a little bit so unless you need the information right now you might find it hard to absorb it all. Although it's difficult to pack so much description without really getting into it. You can almost use it as reference later.

##### Margin notes

Venture captial is a game of outliers and power law distribution. So as an entrepreneur it's your job to communicate why you fall on the left of the curve and why now.

Given current landscape, most VCs realize, just access to capital to not a competitive edge anymore. So find a VC partners that aligns with your domain. Possibly have some expertise to offer in that space. It's a dual relationship, so always make sure you do background checks. It is a long relationship. 

Twitter will tell you fundraising is just the start, so get it out of the way ASAP, and focus on your company building. That's pure bullshit. You have to understand what terms you are getting into. Ofcourse you churn forever but don't work with a VC who isn't patient with you. They see 50 pitches a day, you are probably going to do this once in your lifetime. 

Formulate a strong but simple thesis that you can explain to both VCs and employees. Why now? What forces - market, economic, sociological, psychological, environment are lining up to be able to do this. 

Lot of VCs
