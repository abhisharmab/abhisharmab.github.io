As clickbait-y as the title of this book might seem, it is a **must-read** for anyone trying to bootstrap a startup. You will walk away with a deep understanding of VC workings and get incredibly actionable entrepreneurship advice. As a litmus test; I guarantee your pitch deck, how you approach VCs, which VCs you talk to, and how you evaluate your startup - all of it will change slightly (for the better) after reading this book.

Having started a company before and then later bootstrapping FogHorn at an incubator, I was just appalled at the amount of information asymmetry that exists between VCs and founders, especially technical founders. I learned it myself in hard ways; it made me furious, feel stupid, and even pity myself because as with everything you don't know what you don't know. Most VCs either don't realize or care about this enough, which makes it even worse. In the long run, it doesn't help trust or incentive alignment. Possibly one of the reasons I connected so much with Scott's book. The book is non-pretentious, definitely from the heart, and is genuinely trying to eliminate the asymmetry mentioned above.

Lastly, even if you are mildly curious as to why Silicon Valley seems to only talk in bizarre millions and billions of dollars (funding or exits), you should read it.
