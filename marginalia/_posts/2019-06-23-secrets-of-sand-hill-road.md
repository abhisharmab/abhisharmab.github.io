As clickbait-y as the title of this book might seem, it is a must-read for anyone trying to bootstrap a startup. You will walk away with a deep understanding of VC and get actionable entrepreneurship advice. As a litmus test; I guarantee your pitch deck, how you approach VCs, which VCs you partner with, and how you evaluate your startup - all of it will change slightly (for the better) after reading this book.

Having started a company before and then later bootstrapping [Foghorn](https://www.foghorn.io/) at an incubator, I was appalled at the information asymmetry that exists between LPs, VCs, and founders (especially technical founders). I learned it myself in hard ways. It made me feel furious, stupid, and even pity myself. But as with everything, you don't know what you don't know. In the long run, this disparity doesn't promote trust or incentive alignment. Possibly why I connected so strongly with Scott's book. The book is non-pretentious, from the heart, and is genuinely trying to eliminate the asymmetry mentioned above.

There are way too many useful nuggets to summarize but, personally, if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one meta takeaway - I would say the book helps you develop an appreciation and a working intuition for playing the **incentive alignment** game. Working intuition, once you have it, works like common sense. Kicks in when you need it. As you layout your startup one tile at a time (ideation, prototyping, fundraising, hiring, selling, marketing, partnering, scaling etc.) always ask yourself if the incentives are lining up and are you doing the right thing. You can never build a successful enterprise single-handedly no matter how smart you are or how much money you might have. So it's really important to understand this.

##### What is the incentive alignment anyways?
I am sure you can Google some sort of formal definition. To me it is a balancing act to make sure all the working pieces and people believe in, line up, and point in the same direction. Meaning people are actually correctly incentivized to head towards a common goal.

##### Why is it so important?
It helps: 
* setup the right rewards structures for everyone, 
* inculcates a sense of urgency for progress and motivation,
* reduces tolerance towards complacency, 
* establishes checks & balances in decision making, 
* always helps the keep the long-term view in mind (very underrated).

In no particular order, notes from my margins:

Lastly, even if you are mildly curious as to why Silicon Valley seems to only talk in bizarre millions and billions of dollars (funding or exits), you should read it.
