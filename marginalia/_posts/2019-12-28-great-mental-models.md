[This book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P79P8ST/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_1S8cEb25BWZQX) is a consolidation of the wonderful mental models that Farnam Street has learnt from it's highly distingushed guests. The cover image does a perfect TL;DR on what the book really is - it is an assortment of important thinking concepts (frameworks) that you want:  
  a) to be aware of, and  
  b) keep handy to apply  
whenever you are thinking deeply about a problem or a life decision. It seems Shane has good motivation to assemble this because probably he is trying to teach all this to his kids.
