[This book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P79P8ST/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_1S8cEb25BWZQX) is a consolidation of the wonderful mental models that Farnam Street has learnt over the years from it's highly distingushed guests. The cover image does a perfect TL;DR on what the book really is - it is an assortment of important thinking concepts (frameworks) that you want:  
  a) to be aware of, and  
  b) keep handy to apply    
whenever you are thinking deeply about a problem or a life decision. It seems [Shane Parrish](https://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish) has good motivation to assemble this because probably he is probably trying to teach all these models to his own kids. 

Note, I use the word assemble (with intention) because it is certainly an assembly book. The book does 
_not_ introduce some extensive new research or offer a brand new concept/model per say but rather is a nice consolidation of many important ideas in one single place -- the content is by no means author's original findings and they don't claim so either. Having said that, getting everything organized cohesively isn't easy at all, so kudos to them in my opinion.

What I found most interesting personally is â€” when I look at my notes & highlights of the the whole book after finishing it -- it feels like a super handy pocket reference guide. But at the same time, I can do deep into a rabbit hole with on a particular topic based on my own thoughts/experience coupled with Google search. For instance, if you find a good blog about Occam's Razor online you might want to pull that chapter back up from this book or use your own notes to compare, constrast and/or compliment.

Each chapter unpacks a mental model with description, advantages, gotchas, and a general guideline on when it could be applicable. The recursive theme of each chapter is to take a particular mental model e.g. first principles thinking and then use some real examples from either history or specific individual to describe it with examples. Although, some chapters are definitely much more well written than others. Also, based on your personal situations/experiences you might be able to relate to ideas better than others in terms of "Ok, how do you I apply this in my day to day life?". I would have liked, more examples or real case-studies on how someone used a mental model in multiple scenarios just to get a better imprint on my brain.

The mental models covered in this book are:  
1.Map is _not_ the Territory
2.Circle of Competence 
3.First Principles Thinking
4.Thought Experiments 
5.Second Order Thinking
6.Probabilistic Thinking 
7.Idea Inversion
8.Occam's Razor
9.Hanlon's Razor
10.Falisifability
11.Causation v/s Correlation
12.Necessity & Sufficiency

Apparently, this is first of the series. Book #2 is going to come out in Feb, 2020 as per Shane.
