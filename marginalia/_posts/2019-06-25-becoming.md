Sometimes some books are so engaging that you don't have time to sit down and put notes on the margin. You literally have no time to think because you are actually integrated into every part of the book. Becoming has magic in it's story and packs a punch like no other. Everyone, from every walk of life can associate with it because it is just so simple and just so honest. So the _only_ words I have are: **GO READ THIS BOOK, NOW!!**. 

If you are _not_ much of a reader. Try the audiobook. It's self-narrated and if you have heard Michelle Obama speak reflectively, you will know you don't want her to stop talking.
