title: Tools For Thought
---

I believe augmenting human intellect and memory is an essential ingredient for mankind to make progress. This is my think space and collection of cool resources on tools for thought. I also created a [twitter list](https://twitter.com/abhisharma_b/lists/tools-for-thought1) to continously listen to people working in this space. If, I am missing someone important please [tell me](mailto:abhisharma.b@gmail.com).
