Most creative work is _not_ done with writing proper headlines, titles, or sub-categories. that’s pseudo creative stuff. Creative work is usually messy in the beginning. 

While doing any project: it's hard to focus on just the parts the offer the most ROI. Learn this skill; saying no to features as an engineer is hard. It doesn’t have to be perfect in round one. Always be self debugging mode. 

Dishwasher usage is a great example of how the human brain learns by daily association. How strategically you set it up improve exponentially over time.

It's super important to make easy-to-use tools for thought. It's an amazing general pattern for abstraction. All great tools abstract so much that the users don't even realize how much work is done underneath. This is true for all great products e.g. Google Search (Web), Stripe(Payments), Google Maps(Travel) etc. or even just an excellent book. Great interfaces hide inessential complexity and expose very high leverage actions and representations by Micheal Nielsen.
